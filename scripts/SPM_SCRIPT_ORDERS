Order of SPM scripts executed:

Manually create a matlab sub-01-moves-files.m which copies/unzips the BOLD and anatomical sub 1 files to the SPM preprocessing work directory

Clone_move_files.m
% Takes the sub-01-move-files.m and creates similar scripts for all subjects.

ALL-move-files.m
% A combination of every subjects 'move-files' script. Moves the functional and anatomical images from the DATA directory to the SPM preprocessing work directory. Obtained by first creating sub-01-move-files.m and then cloning for all subjects with Clone_move_files_FSL.m and combining the scripts.

FSLtoSPMonsets.m
% This assumes that the FSL 3-col onsets have already been created, and then combines them creating the multicond.mat onset files used for SPM and places these files in the SPM ONSETS directory. This implements ConvEVtoSPM.m, which we plan will get the condition info from a StudyCondInfo file (...which is manually created...?).

Manually create a sub-01-analysis.m subject/combined level analysis.

Clone_analysis.m
% Clones the sub-01-analysis and creates similar scripts for all subjects.

ALL-analysis.m
% Combination of all subjects -analysis.m files, which is then ran to carry out all the subject-level analyses


Manually create and run a group-nidm.m group analysis file that gives results using NIDM.
