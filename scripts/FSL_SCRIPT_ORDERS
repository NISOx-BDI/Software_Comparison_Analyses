Order of FSL scripts exectued:

Manually create a matlab sub-01-moves-files_FSL.m which copies/unzips the BOLD and anatomical sub 1 files to the FSL preprocessing work directory

Clone_move_files_FSL.m
% Takes the sub-01-move-files_FSL.m and creates similar scripts for all subjects.

ALL-move-files_FSL.m
% A combination of every subjects 'move-files' script. Moves the functional and anatomical images from the DATA directory to the FSL preprocessing work directories. Obtained by first creating sub-01-move-files_FSL.m and then cloning for all subjects with Clone_move_files_FSL.m

GetFSLOnsets.sh
% Obtains the onsets from the _events.tsv files in the DATA directory, and converts them to 3col files in the FSL/ONSETS/ directory

Manually create the first subject level analysis

ConfigFeatPreSC.sh
% Removes variables that will be changed between analysis subjects/runs from the first subject level analysis created, in preparation for ConfigFeatSC.sh to 

ConfigFeatSC.sh
% Uses the first subject level analysis - which has had ConfigFeatPreSC.sh applied to it - to create subject level analysis for all subjects/runs

Run all the .fsf subject level analyses

Manually create a combined analysis for subject 1 (combining all runs)

ConfigFeatPreCombined.sh

ConfigFeatCombined.sh
% Similar to the 'ConfigFeatSC' and 'ConfigFeatPre' scripts except now combining all the runs for each subject

Run all the .fsf comvined level analyses

Manually create and run a group-analysis.fsf
