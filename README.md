To run an SPM (FSL) analysis, set the variables in the process_ds001_SPM.m (process_ds001_FSL.py) script found in the /scripts/ directory appropriately for the study you wish to analyse, 
and then run the script in matlab by entering 'process_ds001_SPM.m' in the matlab command line while in the /scripts/ directory (or, run process_ds001_FSL.py from the terminal with 
'python process_ds001_FSL.py' when in the /scripts/ directory). This will create onsets, preprocess the data, and run first and group level analyses.
